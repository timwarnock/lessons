<h1 class="purple">Welcome to the third lesson</h1>

<h2 class="red">Why is this red?</h2>
<p>Now that you know what HTML is, let's talk about CSS, that is, <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em></p>
<p>Simply put, CSS defines the presentation or <em>style</em> of your webpage. 
  The style includes the fonts, color, padding, border, everything related to what the page should look like.</p>
<p>In other words, the HTML contains the content of the page,
	   and the CSS describes the style.</p> 
<p>Which is why the above heading is <span class="red bold">red</span>! The CSS made it <span class="red bold">red</span>!</p>
<br />


<h2>Why is CSS separate from HTML?</h2>
<p>This is a good question. In order to make a webpage one must write in TWO different languages, one in HTML, and the other in CSS.</p>
<p>Here is an example of what CSS looks like,</p>
<xmp>
  p {
    font-family: sans-serif;
    color: black;
  }

  .red {
    color: red;
  }

  .bold {
    font-weight: bold;
  }

</xmp>

<p>Using the above CSS, I can write HTML like this,</p>
<xmp><p>Is this <span class="red bold">red</span>?</p>
</xmp>
<br />
<p>Which will look like this:</p>
<p>Is this <span class="red bold">red</span>?</p>
<br />
<p>How easy!</p>
<p>In the old days of the <em>World Wide Web</em> we didn't have CSS, instead we mixed our content with our presentation.</p>
<p>We had things like <span class="mono">&lt;FONT&gt;</span> and we abused <span class="mono">&lt;TABLE&gt;</span> tags. 
  Our HTML looked really ugly and was difficult to manage. Don't do this!</p>
<p>With CSS, we have a <em>Separation of Concerns</em>, this means that whoever is working on the content can do so indpendently of the presenation.</p>
<p>In practice, this means a web designer can focus on the CSS without having to worry about the content itself.</p>
<br />





<h2 class="red">Let's get started with CSS</h2>
<p>First things first, how do we link our HTML to our CSS?</p>
<p>Well, there are THREE ways to get your HTML and CSS to work together:</p>
<p><ol><strong>
 <li>External Stylesheet</li>
 <li>Internal Stylesheet</li>
 <li>Inline Style</li>
</strong></ol></p>
<p>Don't worry, it's much easier than it sounds. Let's go through these one by one.</p>
<br />



<br />
<h2>The External Stylesheet</h2>
<p>In this approach, you put all your CSS in a separate file. Easy!</p>
<p>This is the recommended approach, and you'll find most website do exactly this.</p>
<p>Let's try it out!</p>
<br />

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Create a file called <em>style.css</em> in the same directory as example.html</p>
<p>Copy and paste the following into <em>style.css</em> and save.</p>
<xmp>body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  color: gray;
}

.bold {
  font-weight: bold;
}

.purple {
  color: purple;
}

.red {
  color: red;
}

.gray, .grey {
  color: gray;
}
</xmp>
<p>Save this file.</p>
<p>Again, make sure it's called <em>style.css</em> and is in the same directory as <em>example.html</em></p>
<br />


<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>Now we just need to reference <em>style.css</em> in our HTML, it will look like this,</p>
<xmp><link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
</xmp>
<br />

<p>Simple!</p>
<p>Here's an updated <em>example.html</em>, go and ahead and copy and paste this:</p>
<xmp><!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Hello World!
    <p>You just created your first <span class="bold purple">webpage</span>, how exciting!</p>
  </body>
</html>
</xmp>
<p>Save the file, and now open your new <em>example.html</em> in a web browser.</p>
<br />

<p>If you did this correctly, what used to look like:</p>
<p style="font-family: normal; color: black;">Hello World!</p>
<p style="font-family: normal; color: black;">You just created your first webpage, how exciting!</p>
<br />
<p>Should now look like this:</p>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif; color: gray;">Hello World!</p>
<p style="color: gray">You just created your first <span class="bold purple">webpage</span>, how exciting!</p>
<br />

<p>See how easy this is? You can modify the presentation without touching the HTML file.</p>
<p>And best of all, one stylesheet can be used for hundreds of HTML pages! CSS is great!</p>
<p>Now let's learn about the second way to get your CSS and HTML working together, the <em>internal stylesheet</em>.</p>
<br />





<br />
<h2>The Internal Stylesheet</h2>
<p>In this approach, you write your CSS directly inside the <span class="mono">&lt;head&gt;</span> element of your HTML file.</p>
<p>Here's a modified <em>example.html</em>, notice the new <span class="mono">&lt;style&gt;</span> element,</p>
<xmp><!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My test page</title>
    <style>

      p {
        color: black;
      }

    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    Hello World!
    <p>You just created your first <span class="bold purple">webpage</span>, how exciting!</p>
  </body>
</html>
</xmp>

<p>All we did here is put CSS directly inside of our HTML file, i.e.,</p>
<xmp><style>

  p {
    color: black;
  }

</style>
</xmp>
<p>This starts to look ugly, the HTML and CSS are now sharing the same file.</p>
<p>If you have a simple webpage, this approach may work for you. I won't judge!</p>
<p>But if you want to mix it up, let's look at the third way to get CSS and HTML working together, the <em>inline style</em>.</p>
<br />




<br />
<h2>Inline Style</h2>
<p>An inline style allows you to write CSS directly inside each HTML element.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<xmp><p>I want this to be <span style="font-weight: bold; color: purple;">different</span></p>
</xmp>
<p>I want this to be <span style="font-weight: bold; color: purple;">different</span></p>
<br />





<br />
<h2 class="red">Cascading styles...</h2>
<p>What does it mean that a style is <em>cascading</em>?</p>
<p>Let's look at what happens when you have multiple conflicting styles, such as different text color.</p>
<xmp>
This should be gray,
<span class="purple">inside here should be purple, <span class="red">this is red</span>,
  but is this <span class="bold red" style="color: black;">red or black or purple or gray</span>?</span>

</xmp>
<p>Here's what that will look like:</p>
<p style="color: gray;">
This should be gray,
<span class="purple">inside here should be purple, <span class="red">this is red</span>,
  but is this <span class="bold red" style="color: black;">red or black or purple or gray</span>?</span>
</p>

<p>The last part of that line has four competing color definitions, in order:
  <ol>
   <li>the <em>external stylesheet</em> says it should be <span style="color: gray;">gray</span> (defined in style.css), </li>
   <li>the <em>internal stylesheet</em> says it should be <span class="purple">purple</span>, </li>
   <li>the immediate tag says it should be <span class="bold red">bold red</span>, </li>
   <li>and finally the <em>inline style</em> (<span class="mono">style="color: black;"</span>) 
       says it should be <span style="color: black;">black</span>.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>It turns out to be <span class="bold black">bold black</span></p>
<p>The <em>inline style</em> will always take priority over any other inherited style.</p>
<p>The style definitions cascade, overwriting each other based on inheritance.</p>
<p>This is why CSS stands for <em>Cascading</em> Style Sheet.</p>
<br />
<p>Go ahead and experiment in <em>example.html</em> and <em>style.css</em> until you get the hang out of it.</p>

<h1>Welcome to the 9th Lesson</h1>
<p>If you viewed the previous lessons on a mobile device you may have noticed that they look like shit.
   For starters the text appears too small. Zoom in, and the text doesn't wrap,
	which means you have to scroll left and right. Terrible!
    This is a common problem and should be solved with good design.</p>
<p>One solution is called 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design" target="_new">Responsive Web Design</a>.
Responsive web design is an industry buzzword like
User interface plasticity, or
Progressive enhancement, or
Graceful degradation, or
Adaptive web design, or
Content fluidity (or is it Fixity?).
Whenever people talk about these concepts and how they're different, I want to tell them to shove their Corporate Synergy
		 up their ass, I mean, up their Disrputive Paradigm Shifting Strategic Verticals of Adaptively Responsive Web Design.</p>
<p>Let's avoid the nonsense. We just want our webpage to not look like shit.</p>
<br />






<h2>Keep it Simple, Stupid</h2>
<p>This is the KISS principle. It applies to everything in life. Do NOT make things uncessarily complicated.
  Add this single line into the
  <span class="mono">&lt;header&gt;</span> element of the HTML.</p>
<xmp><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
</xmp>
<p>The device-width is the width of a device's screen (like a smartphone screen).
  This will set the webpage to that width. In other words, rotating the device 
   will do what we want it to do. No more side scrolling!
</p>
<p>The "initial-scale=1.0" prevents an initial zoom level (so we're not zoomed way out). 
   For a properly designed website, this is all that's needed to get things working well on a smartphone.
    However, if we've got gigantic fixed-width images and our content doesn't scale to small screens,
    then we've got a lot more work to do to avoid side-scrolling.</p>
<br />




<h2>Image-sizing</h2>
<p>Images can be sized (relative to their container) by using a %, like so:</p>
<xmp><img src="img_kitten_bw_900x240.jpg" style="width:90%">
</xmp>
<img src="img_kitten_bw_900x240.jpg" style="width:90%;" />
<p>Resize the browser and make it really small to see how this works. 
  If you view this on smartphone, rotate your display. The image should scale appropriately.
  </p>
<br />




<h2>@media queries</h2>
<p>CSS allows different styles for different screen sizes.</p>
<p>There are variety of ways to do this, most common is a "media query", like so:</p>
<xmp>@media only screen and (min-width: 720px) {
   ...
}
</xmp>
<p>Any CSS inside the above media query will apply ONLY to screens that are 720 pixels or wider.
  Unfortunately, this can get complicated fast. 
  Let's remember the KISS principle. Start simple with a design
   that looks good on a small display (<i>Mobile First</i>, another buzzword), and then add styles for larger displays.
   </p>
<p>Here's a simple example:</p>
<xmp>#body {
  font-family: Sans-Serif;
  padding: 10px 10px 3em 20px;
  max-width: 800px;
}
#header {
  border-bottom: 3px solid black;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  padding: 20px;
  font-size: 20px;
  background-color: #333;
  color: #d0d0d9;
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 720px) {
  #header {
    padding: 20px 60px;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    font-size: 32px;
  }
  #body {
    padding: 10px 10px 3em 60px;
  }
}
</xmp>
<p>This is an easy way to make sure our webpage doesn't look like shit.
  Just remember to <i>Keep it Simple, Stupid</i>.</p>
<br />




<h2>Make it Complicated</h2>
<p>
This is the opposite of the KISS principle. For example: <i>
Why have 20 lines of effective CSS when we can have 5,000 lines of convoluted nonsense? 
Obviously, there's no job security in 20-lines of CSS.</i>
It should go without saying that this is a terrible idea, but unfortunately there are many 
unnecessary complications within modern web design.
As we'll see, website font-sizing is a great example of this kind of <i>Make it Complicated</i> principle.
</p>

<h3>CSS Font-sizing</h3>
<p>
  In CSS, we can specify a font-size in "px", "pt", "em", "ex", "%", "mm", "in", "ch", "vw", "rem", and maybe a dozen others.
  Most of these, like "px" and "pt", behave the same but offer different numeric measurements (like celsius and fahrenheit), and 
   some function as multipliers, like "%" and "em". So really, it's either a measurement or a multiplier, that's it.
</p>
<p>You may wonder, why are there so many different ways to specify font size?</p>
<p>As best as I can tell, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium" target="_new">W3C</a>
   is fighting an endless battle between people that went to art school and the people who create the browsers.
   Most of the font-sizes come from the world of print, legacy traditions of type-setting and typography, a world where
   we have universal standards of size: an inch is always an inch, a millimeter is always a millimeter,
   and 25.4 millimeters is 1-inch on every single piece of paper that has ever existed.
   On a webpage these rules don't apply. If we project our screen onto the side of a building, an inch can become a meter.
   On a modern smartphone an inch contains more pixels than desktop displays did back when the first CSS standard was written.
</p>
<p>
   I suspect that most designers prefer to use "em" because they went to art school and learned about typography. 
   There are some technical differences between "em" and "px" (pixel), but most designers can't competently
   explain the difference and prefer "em" out of habit, and in many cases they don't even use it correctly.
   You'll find misuse of "em" sizing has led to a lot of awkwardly oversized text and cross-device problems.
   It's sometimes described as the least worse option, but simply leaving out font-size is a much better option
   (because most devices provide sensible defaults).
</p>
<p>
  For example, here's an extremely common style that should never be used:</p>
<xmp>html { font-size: 62.5%; } 
</xmp>
<p>The 62.5% is so common that it's almost universal.
   What this does is reduce the browsers default font-size (16px) by 62.5% (to make it 10px). 
   The reason most often cited is that "em" will now match "px", so after the 62.5%, 1.6em is the same as 16px.
   For similar reasons we may see 0.625em.
   To see why this is unecessarily complicated, let's look at the following example:
  </p>
<xmp>html { font-size: 62.5%; } 
body { font-size: 1.6em; }
</xmp>
<p>This is the same as this:</p>
<xmp> 
</xmp>
<p>Yep, nothing. 1.6em is equivalent to 160%, 62.5% of 160% is just 100%, and we've accomplished nothing.</p>

<p>But wait, the designers say we should use "em" to have consistent (and resizeable) text across all browsers and devices.</p>

<h4>But is that true?</h4>

<p>Well, a long time ago, there was a problem in IE6 (a browser that hasn't been used since 2006). 
	In IE6 a font-size in "px" could not be modified by the user (an accessibility problem). IE6 came out in 2001.
	This is back when people were using <span class="mono">&lt;table&gt;</span>'s to design websites. 
	There were no iPhones. This was before 9/11.
	</p>
<p>Basically, IE6 had terrible support for CSS. IE6 had a lot of problems with "em" as well.
  One particular fix involved setting the html font-size to 100%, which I guess got people into the habit of using a %, 
  and this led to the 62.5% nonsense (ironically, "em" still doesn't work properly in IE6 even with the 62.5% trick).
  Think how odd it is that decades later people "reset defaults" (font-size: 100%), and then set font-size to 62.5%
  in order to use "em" as a numerical equivalent of "px". Instead, they could do nothing and it would
  provide a better experience across all devices. In other words, websites will look like shit LESS OFTEN if we just
  use the default font-size.
  </p>

<h4>What exactly is an em, or a rem?</h4>
<p>As best as I can tell, back when printers used movable type (so, we're back in the year 1440?), 
	the width of a capital M was an "em", and that's where the term comes from, I guess?
  If we're going to reference history, I would have preferred a "g"
  (for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg" target="_new">Gutenberg</a>), but I digress.
</p>
<p> In web design, an "em" is a multiplier.
    So for example, if our inherited style has a 15px font-size and we specify 2em, then our font-size will become 30px.
    It's a percentage expressed without the %-sign, where 1em = 100%, 2em = 200%, etc.
    It's really no more complicated than that, although older browsers did wonky things to em's 
    and for a while there were designers advocating to only use "%".</p>
<p>The "rem", or "root em", is just an "em" without any inherited multiplier, it only multiplies 
  against the "root" (or default) font-size. So "rem" is technically just a measurement (like "px") and not a multiplier.
<p>If we're using "rem" with the 62.5% trick, we're basically just using "px".
   I guess people feel more like artists typing "1.4rem" rather than "14px".
   Apparently, pixels are for nerds, artists use "em"?
   Until rem is more widely supported, designers are stuck trying to figure out the multiplier approach with "em",
   they have no "em" based measurement approach and will end up using "px".</p>

<h4>Why not just use px?</h4>
<p>This is already happening, and it's a perfectly valid approach.
  Modern browsers and smartphones provide competent zoom and font scaling.
  And many designers have found that
  "em" is too confusing to work with (as complicated as exclusively using "%")
  so they're just doing everything in "px".</p>
<p>That said, let's not throw out the baby with the bath water. The 62.5% trick is, well, stupid -- 
  but specifying font-size as a multiplier of the default can be very useful.</p>
<br />


<h2>KISS approach to font-size</h2>
<p><b>1. Use the default font-size.</b> Don't type "font-size" in a stylesheet
    unless you really know what you're doing.
  Trust that every device has provided sensible default font sizes.
  Readable text, like in this paragraph, should use the default font-size.
  Do NOT be presumptious and assume that you know better for all devices and all users.
</p>
<p><b>2. Use "%" sparingly</b>, and always with respect to the default font-size.
  For example, sometimes we need a menu or tool-tip that isn't as large as the normal text 
  and there's no html to get the job done (like <span class="mono">&lt;sub&gt;</span>
    or <span class="mono">&lt;sup&gt;</span>).
  In these cases, use "%" sparingly in order to ensure that we will be respecting all devices and all users.
  Your job isn't to make people with glasses squint, it's to make sure that accessibly-sized fonts don't break the layout.</p>
<p>
  Also, "%" is more compatible across browsers than "em". I'm sorry designers, but that's the truth.
  If you're really concerned about old versions of IE, then don't use "em".
  </p>
<p><b>3. Use "px" sparingly.</b> 
  In some cases it's easier and more reusable to use "px"
    rather than a multiplier font-size (like "em", or "%"). 
  For example, in an image gallery
    with fixed-size previews, it may be necessary to use "px" for the caption.
</p>

<h4>Keep the edge-cases on the edge</h4>
<p>Basically, a good stylesheet should never mention font-size. And if it does, it should do so sparingly with "%"
  or "px". There's no use case for "em" other than making a website look like shit more often than had it not used "em".</p>
<p>That said, there exists edge cases, like if we need our font-size to scale with the viewport width.
  Basically, if we want a block of text to act like an image.
 In this case, we could use "vw" (viewport width).</p>
<xmp><p style="font-size:2.5vw">This is relative to the viewport width!</p> 
</xmp>
<p style="font-size:2.5vw">This is relative to the viewport width!</p> 
<p>Resize the browser window to see how this works.</p>

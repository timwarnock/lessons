<h1>Welcome to the 6th Lesson</h1>
<p>Let's take a minute and talk about the weather :)</p>
<br />

<h2>How's the Weather in London?</h2>
<div id="weatherbox">...</div>
<br />


<h2>How do we do this?</h2>
<p>If you view-soure on this page, you'll see the following HTML:</p>
<xmp><h2>How's the Weather in London?</h2>
<div id="weatherbox">...</div>
</xmp>
<p>That's not very helpful, but notice the empty <span class="mono">&lt;div&gt;</span> with <span class="mono">id="weatherbox"</span>.
  What we can do is use JavaScript to set the text inside that <span class="mono">&lt;div&gt;</span>. </p>
<p>You've already learned how to update the text inside an HTML element, something like this:</p>
<xmp><script>
  function weatherbox(msg = '...') {
    document.getElementById("weatherbox").innerHTML = msg;
  };
</script>
</xmp>
<p>But in this case we first need to know the current weather in London. We'll need our JavaScript to ask Yahoo for the weather.</p>
<br />
<h3>Getting the Weather from Yahoo</h3>
<p>Yahoo provides what's called an API (Application Programmer Interface)
   that you can use to get the current weather for almost every city on earth.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Yahoo no longer supports their open and free weather API, and now requires you to register your API and authenticate with every call.
  I've gone ahead and whitelisted a sample app to use just for this example, but it only works for London weather.
  If you're interested in getting your own API keys and whitelisting your own app, you can read Yahoo's documentation
   <a target="_new" href="https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/">here</a></p>
<p>For now, I've assigned the API response for London weather to a variable called <span class="mono">res</span>, this means you can access
   the API response from the console, e.g.,</p>
<xmp> > res.atmosphere.humidity
 "69"
</xmp>
<p>Go ahead and open the console on this page and test it out.
  You can browse through the <span class="mono">res</span> variable and see all kinds of interesting data.</p>
<br />

<h3>JSON and Callback functions</h3>
<p>There are two important concepts here, JSON and Callback functions. These concepts are almost universal
   in the realm of web applications.</p>
<p><strong>JSON</strong> stands for JavaScript Object Notation,
    but this is just a fancy way of saying that the API responds directly with JavaScript.
    Basically, JSON is JavaScript, and it typically only defines a single object (such as the current weather).</p>
<p><strong>Callback</strong> function is a JavaScript function that will be invoked <em>after</em> the API responds.
   Most web APIs will respond with JSON inside a callback function, which means that when the response is recieved the 
   callback function will be executed.
  In other words, put all your code for handling the API response inside your callback function (and the API will be the one calling it).
  This technique is so common it's referred to as <strong>JSONP</strong> (JSON with Padding), which is just 
  a fancy way of saying JSON inside a callback function. So really, JSONP just means the API will respond with a function call and all of the data
  you want passed in as an argument. A JSONP response looks something like this:</p>
<xmp>callbackFunction( ... the data you want ... );
</xmp>

<p>That's all pretty simple. And if you don't want to mess with Yahoo's convoluted registration and OAuth, you can experiment with my London weather API.
  At the very bottom of this HTML page, you'll see the following,</p>
<xmp><script src="http://avant.net/lessons/lonweather.php?callback=callbackFunction"></script>
</xmp>

<p>At the end of that URL you'll see "<span class="mono">callback=callbackFunction</span>",
   this means the script is expecting that I've ALREADY created a function called (literally) <span class="mono">callbackFunction(res)</span>, 
   where <span class="mono">res</span> is the response. </p>
<p>Here is a template for implementing the callback function. Remember, in the HTML this must come before the API call.</p>
<xmp><script>

  var res;

  // callback function, will be called AFTER we get the weather from Yahoo
  var callbackFunction = function(data) {
    res = data.current_observation;

    ... your code goes here ...

  }

</script>
</xmp>
<br />



<h2>DIY = Do It Yourself</h2>
<p>See if you can use everything you've learned up till now in order to create your own
    HTML page that tells you the weather.
    You can use my London weather API if you don't want to mess with Yahoo's registration and whitelist requests.</p>
<br />


<h2>Are you ready for more?</h2>
<p>Let's move on to <a href="7.html">Lesson 7</a>.</p>
<br />


<script>
  var res;
  function weatherbox(msg = '...') {
    document.getElementById("weatherbox").innerHTML = msg;
  };

  // callback function, will be called AFTER we get the weather from Yahoo
  var callbackFunction = function(data) {
    res = data.current_observation;
    //
    // set color and description of temp, humi(dity), and wind
    var pubdate = new Date(res.pubDate * 1000).toISOString().slice(0, 16).replace(/-/g, "/").replace("T", " ");
    var temp = res.condition.temperature;
    var humi = res.atmosphere.humidity;
    var wind = res.wind.speed;
    var temp_style = temp>25 ? '#c33' : temp<17 ? '#33c' : '#3b3';
    var humi_style = humi>60 ? '#33c' : humi<30 ? '#c33' : '#3b3';
    var wind_style = wind>38 ? '#c33' : wind<10 ? '#33e' : '#3b3';
    var temp_desc  = temp>25 ? 'an uncomfortable' : temp<17 ? 'a chilly' : 'a comfortable';
    var humi_desc  = humi>60 ? 'an uncomfortable' : humi<30 ? 'a dry'    : 'a comfortable';
    var wind_desc  = wind>38 ? 'a stormy'         : wind<10 ? 'a calm'   : 'a breezy';
    weatherbox('<p>According to Yahoo (at ' + pubdate + '), it\'s <em>' + res.condition.text + '</em> outside</p>'
      + '<p>the temperature is ' + temp_desc + ' <em id="weatherbox_temp">' + temp + ' ' + 'celsius' + '</em></p>'
      + '<p>the humidity is ' + humi_desc + ' <em id="weatherbox_humi">' + humi + '%</em></p>' 
      + '<p>and the wind is ' + wind_desc + ' <em id="weatherbox_wind">' + wind + ' ' + 'km/h' + '</em></p>'
    );
    document.getElementById("weatherbox_temp").style.color = temp_style;
    document.getElementById("weatherbox_humi").style.color = humi_style;
    document.getElementById("weatherbox_wind").style.color = wind_style;
  };
